stopmodreposts.gui.information.information=\u00A7l\u00A76 Have you downloaded all your mods from sources that you know are reliable? No?\u00A7r\n\nWell then you might have a problem, lots of websites re-host mods without the author's permission. The problem with these sites, is that a lot of them advertise versions of the mod that don't exist, or have outdated versions that lead to bugs, crashes and glitches that could have been avoided had you downloaded the mod from the author's intended platform. Some websites even go so far as to include viruses and other forms of malware that can damage your computer.\n \nIn order to be safe from such risks in the future, you should only download mods from reputable sources, including (but not limited to!) Curseforge, Modrinth, PlanetMinecraft and the official Minecraft forums.\n\u00A7l\u00A76How do you know which websites can be trusted or not?
