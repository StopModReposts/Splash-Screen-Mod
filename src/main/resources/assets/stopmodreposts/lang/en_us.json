No?\u00A7r\n\nWell, then you might have a problem since lots of sites re-host mods without any permissions. Some of them also add malware to these files.\n \nIn order to be safe from such risks in the future, only download mods from trustworthy platforms, such as CurseForge or from transparent open-source platforms, such as Modrinth or GitHub. Make sure the author uploaded the mod themselves to the platform.\n\nPress the button on the left if you want to know more about this, and be safe in the future. We have a browser extension that helps you to not accidentally download mods from such sites.",
	"stopmodreposts.gui.information.information2": "How can you be sure that the mods you are using now are safe?\nIf you have downloaded mods from places other than the mod author's intended page, you may be at risk of getting viruses. There are many websites that let you download Minecraft mods, and a lot of them are unsafe. Many websites host mods without their creators' approval - these are often outdated or buggy, and can sometimes come bundled with dangerous malware.\nTo avoid getting viruses and malware, and to support mod authors, make sure you only ever download mods from trustworthy and/or open-source platforms."
