# Forge Version

## What does this Mod do?
The StopModReposts Splash-Screen Mod adds this beautiful GUI, in order to educate more users about the problem of mod reposting sites.
And don't worry, it does only show up once per Minecraft Directory. (Once per installation location)</br>
![Preview Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StopModReposts/Splash-Screen-Mod/master/preview.png)</br>
The Goal of this project isn't to accuse people of something, but rather to educate them.</br>
That a person downloaded the file from curseforge, doesn't mean that it knows what repost sites are.

## How can I help as a Modder?
If you want to help just embed this mod into your mod.
The more players read this, the better our chances are.
* Embedding the mod means that the mod jar will be put into your mod jar, and forge will extract this mod.

### How to embed this Mod?
The first thing you need to do is build the mod yourself, as it doesn't have a maven repo yet:
```
gradlew build
```

Then put the `stopmodreposts.jar` file into `./libs` (`<Your main mod folder that also contains gradlew.bat>/libs`).

After that you need to enable Jar-in-Jar to embed the mod into your own mod. To do so add this to your build.gradle file:
```GRADLE
jarJar.enable()

repositories {
    /* Your other Mod Repositories, might be empty */

    flatDir {
        dir 'libs'
    }
}

dependencies {
    /* Your other Mod Dependencies */

    implementation fg.deobf("org.stopmodreposts:stopmodreposts:1.0")
    jarJar(group: 'org.stopmodreposts', name: 'stopmodreposts', version: '[1.0,1.1)')
}
```
The ```jarJar.enable``` can be anywhere in the build script but I would suggest to put it under ```java.toolchain.languageVersion```</br>
(Note: the text you add in the ```dependencies``` block *needs* to be under ```net.minecraftforge``` to work!)</br>
Now you just need to refresh your gradle project and you're good to go:
```
gradlew --refresh-dependencies
gradlew genEclipseRuns / genIntellijRuns
gradlew eclipse / intellij
```

If you need more help using jar-in-jar look at the [Forge Community Wiki Page about Jar-in-Jar](https://forge.gemwire.uk/wiki/Jar-in-Jar)

## How can I help as a User?
